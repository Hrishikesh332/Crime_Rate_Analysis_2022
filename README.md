# Crime Rate Analysis 2022

Crime analysis in this project helps to identify and decipher different trends and patterns in the crimes happenning around us. This approach is beneficial for the police dept officials as it guides them to take appropriate measures to maintain law & order in the region. They can easily identify the crime prone regions and deploy patroling accordingly. A lot of significant insights can be gathered and reasearched on for reducing the crime rates.

## Documentation

🔼**About Power BI**

Power BI is a collection of software services, 
apps, and connectors that work together to turn 
your unrelated sources of data into coherent, 
visually immersive, and interactive insights.

Data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a 
collection of cloud-based and on-premises 
hybrid data warehouses.

Power BI lets you easily connect to your data 
sources, visualize and discover what's 
important, and share that with anyone or 
everyone you want.

🔼**DAX Language**

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values.

We have used DAX in our project for creating custom measures, columns and tables. It transforms the data to much better state and useful for analysis.


🔼**Crime Dataset**

The dataset source is Chicago crime department. They update the crime related data in real time on their website. It is publically available for reasearch purposes and exploration.

🔆Here is the link to the live dataset : [Chicago crime rate](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g)

🔆Also you can find different live datasets for different domains here : [Chicago city data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

The dataset used in our project contains the crime records of the year 2022 specifically.
